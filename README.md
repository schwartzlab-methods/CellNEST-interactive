# ![alt text](https://github.com/schwartzlab-methods/nest-interactive/blob/main/nest_logo.svg) NEST-Interactive
## Used python packages:
  ```
  django
  numpy
  scipy
  matplotlib
  pandas
  altair
  django-cors-headers
  ```
## Required preprocessed metadata and output files from the NEST model
We need the following five files:
1. cell_barcode_*.csv file generated by NEST in the data preprocessing step. 
2. coordinates_*.csv file generated by NEST in the data preprocessing step.
3. *_self_loop_record.gz file generated by NEST in the data preprocessing step.
4. Optional *_annotation.csv file, if available.
5. NEST_*_top20percent.csv file generated by NEST in the data postprocessing step.
   
Keep these five files under the same directory and use that directory path while running the interactive version as explained below.

## Instructions to run NEST Interactive:
Navigate into the pulled nest_interactive directory. Please run the following command with three arguments:
1. Desired port to run the frontend, e.g., 8080
2. Path to the directory having NEST output and required metadata files, e.g., barcode, coordinates, etc.
3. Name of the data that you want to visualize on the interactive nest, e.g., PDAC_64630 or V1_Human_Lymph_Node_spatial (the --data_name argument that is used during running the NEST model).

````
bash nest_interactive 8080 server/data/files/ PDAC_64630
````

However, if you are interested to run the frontend and backend separately, you can follow the instructions below. 

#### Frontend:

1. If VSCode is installed, adding the "Live Server" extension from Ritwick Dey makes spinning up a server easy. Access the server hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5500/HTML%20file/NEST-vis.html
2. Otherwise
   - Run `python -m http.server 8080` from the root directory
   - Open http://localhost and navigate to "HTML file" then "NEST-vis.html"
   - Server should be hosted at http://localhost/HTML%20file/NEST-vis.html

#### Backend:

- Navigate into the server directory (`cd server`)
- Install pipenv
- Run `pipenv shell` then `pipenv install`

  - The required packages are:
  ```
  django
  numpy
  scipy
  matplotlib
  pandas
  altair
  django-cors-headers
  ```

- OPTIONAL: To use your own input files, upload them in a directory under server/data. Note that the name of this directory is referred to as *DIRECTORY_NAME* and the common identifier across file names is referred to as *FILE_IDENTIFIER* (e.g. cell_barcode_**PDAC_64630**). For custom data, run `python ./manage.py setdata DIRECTORY_NAME FILE_IDENTIFIER`. To return to default, run `python ./manage.py setdata ./data/files/ PDAC_64630`
- Run `python ./manage.py runserver`
